**How to Choose A Web Font:**

*Raising awareness:*

Humans are emotional, everything we see affects us in one way or another. Therefore, before choosing the font (s) for your next web project, first consider the message you want to communicate to your final users. For example, is your “under-construction” website going to be about a formal business such as financial investment firm? Or it is going to be about an innovated and fun way to purchase food online? Depending on your answers, you can look for fonts that will help to identify what is the intent of the business to the user.



In this example, we see a firm of layers that want to be taken seriously. Did they achieve that goal?

Additionally, considered your target audience age when choosing fonts. For example apps such as Robinhood investment or eToro, are applications that focus on young people that don’t have the experience of investing in stocks and options, therefore the fonts used in these type of applications are more friendly and clean, instead of classy or shiny font colors. Your target audience should also determinate the font you should use on your next project.
