  In this blog, in Discuss Part 1, you will find and article about optimizing
  images for the web by Adrian Bece. 


  Then, in Discuss Part 2, you will find an imbedded Codepen of my creation inspired by another Codepen from the Autor name Rusty, who is using masking in CSS by scaling images and shapes.

*As developers we must understand that although it is important to always deliver the best possible images on a website or application, we must also understand that it should not be by compromising the performance of our project. For that reason, I see this article very important which I would grade 10 or 10. I recommend to the developer community to read this article in other to make better decisions when adding images while designing a page. We must consider balancing quality with effectiveness. I won’t make sense for us to have a beautiful page with the best possible images, if it takes seconds to load, seconds that feel like hours. I agree with Arian Bece, because resizing the images (cropping) and reducing the weight (pixels) helps us reduce the loading time of our projects in the device's user. Therefore, I find Bece’s article helpful, because he provides the standard all developers should know to calculate how much weight are we adding to our website per image that we attempt to upload.*

*In the past semester (Spring 2020), we saw together with Professor Caruso that there comes a point where the human eye does not distinguish between an extremely high quality image and a good well looking image, so reducing its weight (quality) will not actually make any difference in terms of quality in the human eye. However, if it helps us in terms of productivity and efficiency. In short, I would recommend this article to all developers and students interested in becoming developers.*
